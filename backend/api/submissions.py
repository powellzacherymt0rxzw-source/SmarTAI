"""Submissions API router — student online submission and teacher batch import.

Student and teacher ingestion both call the same submission service, which
flows through one immutable-revision pipeline. File upload variants land in a
follow-up; this router exposes structured-answer submission + teacher import so
the revision workflow is testable without the LLM parse path.
