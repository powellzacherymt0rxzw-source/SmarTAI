"""Results read models: teacher summary, per-student result, per-question
aggregates, review queue, and released student result (Task 8).

Deterministic aggregates (averages, counts, score distribution) are computed
from normalized SQL/result rows here, never pre-baked during grading. The
common-mistake analysis stays an on-demand endpoint backed by ``analytics_agent``;
it does not block grading or become the source for deterministic statistics.
