"""
Problem classification tool.

Uses an LLM to decide the type of a problem (概念题/计算题/编程题/证明题/推理题/其他).
Classification is a TOOL, not a skill — skills consume a type that's already
been decided.

Called by:
  - backend/agents/ingest_agent.py when parsing uploaded assignments
  - re-classification after human edits to a problem stem
