"""Submission use cases: online answers, teacher batch import, immutable
revisions, and answer correction.

Both ingestion paths flow through one pipeline: ``create_submission`` (the
single current submission row, enrollment + open-state gated) then
``add_revision`` (a new immutable revision with normalized answer rows). The
only difference is the ``source`` enum and who is the actor.

Teacher batch import resolves each student id explicitly and returns a
per-student success/failure record; a partial import never reports full success
("partial failure cannot silently report full success"). Answer correction is a
new revision, never an in-place mutation.
