"""Normalized education schema baseline (Task 1).

Asserts that a fresh database contains exactly the retained auth/provider/
knowledge tables plus the normalized education tables, and that the structural
invariants from the approved design are enforced in metadata (not just by
application code): no ``users.course_ids`` compatibility mirror, a non-null
assignment ``version`` for optimistic locking, the course/enrollment and
assignment/student uniqueness rules, immutable submission revision numbering,
and the single-active-grading-run partial unique index.
