"""Regression tests for the GitHub Actions CI workflow (Task 1 CI failures).

The CI workflow in ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` had three failure modes that
these tests pin down so they cannot silently regress:

* The SQLite backend job installed only ``render-requirements.txt`` (no
  ``pytest``), so the test step aborted with ``No module named pytest``.
* The E2E job used ``wait-on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ready``. ``wait-on`` issues
  an HTTP ``HEAD`` for plain HTTP URL resources, while FastAPI's ``/ready``
  route is GET-only, so the readiness wait timed out with 405s.

These tests read the workflow YAML as text and assert the fixes stay in place.
They do not execute the workflow; they are static guards against regression.
